Equity Improvements 
Our aim is to simplify appliance ownership, maintenance, and lifecycle management
We will drive toward a better appliance lifecycle through better data management, automated maintenance calendaring, and so much more to simplify appliance ownership.

Our approach: The initial aim is to create a simple app to have users take a picture of their appliance nameplate, then take action to build the data value from there forward. 

We aim to financially solidify our role through providing timeless value creation, by providing customers with easy tools to better take care of their appliance lifecycle. 
At a later stage, we will develop some really cool cross-over incorporating NFTs and Smart Contracts.
